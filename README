This is an efficient C++ implementation of the POPC binary feature clustering algorithm.

BUILDING
========
1. Enter project top-level directory, and type 'make'.
2. At the moment, there is no 'install' target, so include files incorporating the main header-only POPC C++ library must use one of various methods to directly reference the header file by path (e.g. compiler -I flag, full #include path).
